# Zava Communities of Practice: ES6+

## The What?

We cover some interesting topic on this COP:

- `var` versus `let` and `const`.
- Fat arrow vs `function`.
- Advanced object properties.
- Classes
- Maps

## Running the examples

JavaScript code can be run in the browser and in the server, so can run it under the
environment you want. The only thing you have to keep in mind if you are going to run
it in the browser to make sure that the one you use has support for ES6+ features.

Alternatively, you can run the examples using `nodejs` on your local machine:

```
node 0-var/1.js
```

And you will see the output:

```
1
1
```
